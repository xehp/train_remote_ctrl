The plan was to use this to interface our STM32 via optical link with this SCPI compatible multimeter:
BK5491B -  Digital Bänkmultimeter, 50 000 räkningar, Sann RMS, Manuell skala, 1 kV, 20 A, 4,75-siffrig 
	https://www.bkprecision.com/products/multimeters/5491B-50000-count-true-rms-bench-digital-multimeter.html
	farnell:1852748
	digikey:BK5491B-ND
	elfa:301-15-324

	9pin DSUB
	This unit is designed to be connected to BK precision multimeters.
	These units don't seem to drive RTC and CTS so we need to steal power from the data signal.
	See chapter 5.2.1    RS-232 Connection in http://bkpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/manuals/en-us/5492B_manual.pdf
	The multimeter will use these pins:
	Transmitted Data	TXD	3
	Received Data		RXD	2
	Signal Ground Common	GND	5


	Null modem cable

			NOTE:
				Minimum Supply Voltage for Function V CC min 4 Volts  (3.3 Volts it too little)
				The SFH551/1-1 receiver is a transimpedance amplifier
				with a TTL open-collector output stage, therefore a
				pull-up resistor of at least 330 Ω is necessary for full speed.


C1, C2, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11
	Capacitors 0.1 uF to 1 uF.
	Prefer 0.1 uF for most exept C9 & C10 where 1 uF is prefered.


C3
	Optional
	Capacitor 10 nF


R1
	Pull up resistors, 33k Ohm


R2
	Recomended for full speed is 330 Ohm.
	But we use only upp to 115000 baud so 1 kOhm will be fine.

R3
	Resistor, Max allowed If on Transmitter is 50 mA and forward voltage is typical 2 V. 
	So if signal is 5 V then R shall be R=U/I = 3/0.05 Ohm = 60 Ohm minimum
	So 100 Ohm here should be fine.

	1 kOhm

		placing 5 - 10 of 10 MOhm resistors in series into a tube.
		The low voltage resistor (100 kOhm) is mounted as close to volt meter as possible.
		Some connectors and lab cables needed also.

	TODO
		Would be good to have a third sensor for ambient temperature. 
		That way we could stop machine if coils do not warm up as expected.
